# Big Mart Sales Prediction
It is a regression problem.

# Problem statement
The Data scientist have collected Big Mart sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities for the year 2009. 
Now each prpduct has certain attributes that sets it apart from other products. Same is the case with each store.
The aim is to build a predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store so that it would help the decision makers
at BigMart to find out the properties of any product or store, which play a key role in increasing the overall sales.
